<p>This is the home page for Omnifit, the python library intended to help with the analysis of astronomical spectra for signs of interstellar ices.</p>

<h3><a id="2nd-november-2015" class="anchor" href="#2nd-november-2015" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2nd November 2015 - v0.2.0</h3>
<p>
Omnifit v0.2 has been released! The most significant change in this version is the support for Kramers-Kronig relation calculations, which allow you to produce complex refractive indices from transmittance data of laboratory-grown ices. See the <a href="doc/changelog_link.html#changes-in-0-2-0">changelog</a> for a full list of changes in this version.
</p>
<p>
Next up: Better documentation and Python 3 compatibility!

<p>
This started out as an attempt at improving the (so far) only example in the documentation, but also ended up revealing a bug in the spectrum interpolation method. The bug has been fixed and the documentation has been improved. Enjoy!

<h3><a id="8th-september-2015" class="anchor" href="#8th-september-2015" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>8th September 2015 - Pypi support</h3>
<p>
Happy September! After a few tries, pypi installation should now work. Go check out the <a href="doc/installation.html#using-pip">documentation</a> to see how you can now install Omnifit in a slightly easier fashion.

<h3><a id="25th-august-2015" class="anchor" href="#25th-august-2015" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>25th August 2015 - Documentation, DOIs, and version 0.1</h3>
<p>The documentation button which appeared on the page during the weekend is now working. Also citation info via a DOI generated using Zenodo is now available for Omnifit. Please remember to cite properly it if you publish something which makes use of Omnifit!</p>

<p>Also, Omnifit now officially has a v0.1 release. This has all the basic functionality tested and working properly.</p>

<p>Work will immediately start happening on v0.2, which will contain additional features which have been in the planning for a while now, and on which work can now start once the base library is working well enough. Watch this space for information on those when it becomes available!</p>

<p>Today marks the day when Omnifit is finally ready to be made publicly available; rejoice!</p>
<p>You can now download the latest development version of Omnifit from the <a href="https://github.com/RiceMunk/omnifit">Github repository</a>, and start using it at your leisure.</p>
<p>Please keep an eye on this site in the coming days for information on documentation (which is currently only contained as part of the repository) and for ways to cite Omnifit when you use it to analyse your data.</p>
<p>Also if you use Omnifit and find bugs or other problems with it, remember to report these on the <a href="https://github.com/RiceMunk/omnifit/issues">issue tracker</a> so that they can be fixed in upcoming releases.</p>
<p>Happy fitting!</p>

<p>Omnifit was originally created by Aleksi Suutarinen (<a href="https://github.com/RiceMunk" class="user-mention">@RiceMunk</a>), who is also the maintainer of the Omnifit repository. Some methodologies originally developed by J. A. Noble have been adapted from IDL to Python in Omnifit.</p>
