Changelog
=========
Changes in 0.2.1
----------------
 * Properly parsing requirements on installation now (issue #15)
 * Made fitting compatible with lmfit versions higher than 0.9 (issue #22)
 * Consequently this made omnifit incompatible with lmfit versions lower than 0.9, so dropped support for those
 * Made spectrum convolution work properly with astropy 1.1
 * Updated full fitting example in documentation to reflect the new format being used for complex refractive indices

Changes in 0.2.0
----------------
 * Kramer-Kronig relation implementation added to utils
 * Example for using the KK relation added to documentation
 * Tests for KK relation
 * Added pip-requirements file
 * Fixed issue #16 of spectrum convolution breaking units

Changes in 0.1.2
----------------
 * Fixed issue #12 of interpolation breaking units
 * Fixed example in documentation and made it more easy to test

Changes in 0.1.1
----------------
 * Added pypi support.
 * Added BSD license notification.

Changes in 0.1
--------------
 * This is the first public release version of Omnifit.
 * Most spectrum manipulation methods now have an option of returning a new spectrum instead of modifying the existing spectrum.
 * Arbitrary arguments can now be passed from the constructors of child classes to their parents.
 * It is now possible to give arbitrary matplotlib arguments to the various plotting methods used by Omnifit, and the amount of 'hard-coded' functionality has been minimized in these methods.
 * The spectrum classes now preferentially make use of Astropy quantity arrays instead of Numpy arrays to store their data. Also the unit conversions are now performed by the Astropy functions related to unit conversions, instead of the limited number of conversions previously supported by Omnifit.
 * Convolution now makes use of Astropy convolution routines instead of Numpy convolution routines.
 * Sphinx documentation added.
 * Numerous minor bugfixes.
